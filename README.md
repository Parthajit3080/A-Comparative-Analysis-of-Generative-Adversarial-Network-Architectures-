# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Generative-Adversarial-Network-Architectures-


Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a significant paradigm in generative artificial intelligence, yet their training is notoriously fraught with instability, mode collapse, and vanishing gradients. This report presents a rigorous comparative analysis of three distinct GAN architectures to evaluate their efficacy in overcoming these challenges. We implement and train a foundational Vanilla GAN, the theoretically-grounded Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and their comparison in generating better results across different datasets with change in different hyperparameters. These models are systematically evaluated across three datasets of increasing complexity and diversity: the handwritten digits of MNIST, the natural object images of CIFAR-10, and a high-variance Anime Face dataset. Performance is assessed through a multi-faceted protocol, including quantitative metrics-Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS)-qualitative inspection of generated sample fidelity and diversity, and an analysis of training dynamics. Our findings empirically validate the superior stability and sample quality of WGAN-GP over the WGAN and Vanilla GAN, particularly on complex, high-dimensional data. This work contributes a comprehensive empirical benchmark and provides insights into the synergistic potential of combining adversarial and contrastive learning principles for robust image synthesis.
